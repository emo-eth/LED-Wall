Project I was doing on my own and adapted for my Music Cognition & Perception class at UC Berkeley.

The paper covers the methodology and experiment examples. Folders include processing code (adapted for both LED board and on-screen examples). Video folder includes visual example of each program/experiment.

Inspired by/adapted heavily from http://dorkbotpdx.org/blog/armatronix/led_video_wall
